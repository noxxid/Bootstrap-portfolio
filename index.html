                <p>Hello there! My name is John Dixon, I currently work for VASA Fitness at the front desk and I love
                    computers. I've been
                    an avid gamer since I got my first game on PC, Call of Duty. A while after I got into the game I
                    went pro with a team I
                    played with for a long time before life got too busy and I had to focus on other things.</p>

                <p>My ultimate dream now is to be a professional MMA fighter with a side gig of streaming myself playing
                    video games I
                    enjoy online. In the meantime however we all have to make a living and I've recently become obsessed
                    with coding.</p>

                <p> My ultimate goal is to get myself into social media management and possibly helping build websites
                    for smaller local
                    buisnesses who may be having a hard time competing in the current market against some of these
                    larger corporations who
                    may be better equipped for the modern day.</p>
